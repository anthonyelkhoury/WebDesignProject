Welcome to my Web Design project, created as part of a college course. This project is a simple e-commerce website developed using HTML and CSS. I designed the logo and several images myself, utilizing Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator. The website features clothing and accessories for both men and women. All code and design elements are 100% original and crafted by me. You may start by checking the homepage first!
